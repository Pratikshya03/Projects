## Modules Used

### 1. **Tkinter**
   Tkinter is the standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In this project, it is utilized to design and manage the entire game interface for the 2048 game. Tkinter handles key tasks such as:
   
   - **Creating the Game Window:** The main game window, including the grid layout, tiles, and score display, is built using Tkinter.
   - **Handling User Input:** It captures user actions like key presses (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles on the game board.
   - **Displaying Visual Elements:** Tkinter is responsible for displaying dynamic game elements, such as the board and tiles, and updating them as the game progresses.
   
   **Note:** Tkinter is bundled with Python and does not require separate installation.

### 2. **Random**
   The `random` module is a part of the Python standard library and is used to add randomness to the game. It plays a critical role in generating new tiles after each move. Here's how the `random` module is used in this project:
   
   - **Generating Random Numbers:** It determines the placement and value (either 2 or 4) of the new tiles that appear after each move.
   - **Random Tile Insertion:** Ensures that new tiles are placed in random empty positions on the board.

   **Note:** As part of the Python standard library, the `random` module requires no additional installation.
